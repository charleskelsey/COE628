**Lab 1:** Implement a Priority Queue using a linked list
  * Works properly

**Lab 2:** Learn hot to use command line arguments in C program. Learn how to give the same program different names and make it behave differently according to the
name it is invoked by. Run multiple processes simultaneously and coordinate them using an atomic command.
  * Part A has wrong output and wrong exit code
  * Part B has wrong output
  
**Lab 3:** Learn how to use fork(), execXXO, and wait(). Write a simple shell.
  * The fork and the child  process are not working as expected
  
**Lab 4:** Learn how to use dup2 (and/or dup) and pipe. Write a simple shell to support piping.
  * The code failed to pass all test cases
  
**Lab 5:** Learn how to use threads in C (using the POSIX pthread package).
  * Works properly
  
**Lab 6:** Learn how to synchronize threads in a POSIX, compliant operating system using C
  * Works properly
  
**Lab 7:** The basics of multi-threading in a programming language that supports the monitor concept of concurrency control.
  * Works properly
  
**Lab 8:** Implemet a basic Semaphore in Java.
  * The code failed to pass all test cases
  
**Lab 9:** The Dining Philosophers Project. The main objectives are learning deadlock and the dining philosophers. It also includes dolving deadlock with semaphores (Java).
  * The code works properly
